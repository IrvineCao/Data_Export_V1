# User Guide - Data Exporter Pro 📊

Welcome to the world of Data Exporting! Think of this tool as your personal data superhero, ready to rescue your data from the chaos of numbers. But first, read these instructions so you don't end up like that guy who didn't read the manual... *you know who you are*. 👀

## 1. Getting Started: Login 🖥️

We gotta know who you are, because **who’s gonna save the world without knowing your name**? 
- **Mandatory Requirement:** Before you can wield the power of data exporting, enter your name in the "Login" field in the sidebar and click "Start Session". 
- **Session:** You’re logged in. Until you hit "Logout" like it's the end of a Netflix binge. ✌️

## 2. Filling in Query Information 🤔

Time to tell us what data you want, and we’ll give it to you faster than you can say "Where's my data?"

### Workspace ID 💼:

- Enter the ID of the workspace. You know, that magical number that makes everything tick. 

### Storefront EID 🏬:

- Enter one or more Storefront EIDs, separated by commas. Max 5 Storefronts. And remember: **they all gotta belong to the same workspace!** No intergalactic data mixing, alright?

### Date Range 📅:

- Choose your date range. Make sure to pick a date that's not from the 1990s, or we won’t be able to help you (or maybe we will... just kidding).

**Limits:**
- 1-2 storefronts = 60 days max
- 3-5 storefronts = 30 days max
- *Because too much data = system meltdown! 🤯*

## 3. The 4-Step Data Export Process 🔄

The data export process is like making a sandwich—*you gotta follow the steps to get the best results.*

### Step 1: Preview Data 🔍

- Fill out the form and hit "Preview Data". This will show you the first 500 rows of data. It's like a little taste before the full meal. 🥪

### Step 2: Review the Export Summary 📜

A summary will pop up with all the important stuff:
- **Total Rows (Estimated):** Like the calories in a cake—this number will tell you how big your data feast is.
- **Date Range:** How much time you're covering. Choose wisely.
- **Number of storefronts:** Because bigger isn't always better, right?
- **Preview Query Time:** How fast are we going? Lightning speed, or a tortoise pace? 🐢

### Step 3: Export Full Data 🚀

- Ready to go full throttle? Hit "Export Full Data". Buckle up—this could take a minute, depending on how much data you're dealing with. 🚀

### Step 4: Download 🧳

- When it's ready, you'll get the "Download CSV Now" button. Hit it like it’s a VIP pass to your own personal data concert. 🎤

## 4. Important Notes ⚠️

### Large Data Limit 🚫

- If you try to export more than 50,000 rows... **it’s gonna be blocked**. We’re not trying to crash the system like it's 1999, y’know? 
- **Solution:** Narrow the date range or reduce the number of storefronts. Easy fix. ✨

### Start New Export 🔄

- Done? Or need a new query? Hit "Start New Export" and it’s like hitting "Ctrl + Alt + Delete" to refresh everything. 🚪

### Activity Logging 🕵️‍♂️
