    The first step is to choose the type of data you want to export. Use the navigation sidebar on the left to find the report you need. Reports are grouped into categories:

    - **Storefront in Workspace**: Provides a list of all storefronts associated with a specific workspace.
    - **Keyword Lab**: Offers deep insights into keyword performance, search volume, and competitor data.
    - **Digital Shelf Analytics**: A collection of reports for analyzing keyword performance, product tracking, and more.

    - **Workspace ID (`*`)**: This is the unique identifier for your workspace. You must enter a single, numeric ID.
    - **Storefront EID (`*`)**: Enter the EID for the storefront(s) you want to analyze. You can enter a single ID or multiple IDs separated by commas (e.g., `123, 456, 789`).
    - **Date Range (`*`)**: Select the start and end dates for your analysis. The data exported will be from within this time period.

    st.markdown("""
    Some reports have optional filters to help you refine your results even further. You can leave these set to `None` to include all data, or select a specific option to narrow the results.
    - **Device Type**: Filter data based on whether the user was on a `Desktop` or `Mobile` device.
    - **Display Type**: Filter by how the product was displayed, such as `Paid`, `Organic`, `Top`.
    - **Product Position**: Filter by the position of the product, such as `-1 (All)`, `4`, `10`.

with st.expander("Why is the 'Get Data' button disabled?"):
    st.markdown("The button is disabled if any required fields (marked with `*`) are empty or contain invalid data. Please check that you have entered a valid, numeric Workspace ID and at least one Storefront EID.")

with st.expander("How long will the full export take?"):
    st.markdown("Export time depends on the size of the data. For very large date ranges or many storefronts, it might take a few minutes. The preview is designed to be fast, while the full export is more comprehensive.")

with st.expander("What does 'None' mean in a filter?"):
    st.markdown("Selecting `None` in an optional filter means you are not applying that filter. For example, setting `Device Type` to `None` will include data from both Desktop and Mobile devices.")

with st.expander("Who can I contact for help?"):
    st.markdown("If you encounter an error or have questions about the data, please reach out to the Irvine.")
